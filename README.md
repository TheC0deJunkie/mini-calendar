# Mini Calendar ðŸ“…

## Overview
I created a simple, elegant Mini Calendar web application that dynamically displays the current date. This project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating a responsive and visually appealing calendar display.

## Features
- Automatically shows today's date
- Displays day of the week
- Shows current month and year
- Responsive design with a gradient background
- Clean, modern UI

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript

## How It Works
The application uses JavaScript's `Date` object to retrieve and display the current date. The design features a split layout with the date on the left and month/year on the right, styled with a vibrant color scheme.

## Design
- Responsive full-screen layout
- Linear gradient background
- White calendar card with red accent
- Large, readable typography
